# Cryptogram
The goal of this project was to create a cryptogram game which offers both integer and character varients and 
gives the user the ability to create an account,track their stats across games, save and load cryptograms. 
I was responsible for creating the cryptogram class which was a basis for how the game would be created. 
I also created the save feature so that players could save their stats and current game progress in between games.
This tied in with an already established account feature. 
I also made a hint feature which would auto-fill random letters on the board to assist the user. 
In addition to fulfilling my responsibilities I took part in refactoring code and assisting others with issues their faced throughout development. 
We received a score of 95% for this assignment.
